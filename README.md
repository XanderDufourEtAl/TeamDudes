The Problem Statements:
1) UMaine sports are a hub of the community, and a staple of Umaine, but the associated website which provides scores, game and player statistics, and game times, do not match in quality, the level of importance these sports hold for our university. The problem arises because the current solutions for finding this information are difficult to navigate, requiring you to visit multiple pages for each individual sport. It can also feel overwhelming to the average user, as the information is densely packed, shorthanded ad nauseam, and lacks convenience of layout. College sports of this caliber and popularity are held back by the inaccessibility and inefficiency of their associated websites.
